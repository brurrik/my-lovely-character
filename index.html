            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Dr. Filthy Francis or Francis of the Filth, simply known as Filthy Frank, was the titular protagonist of the TVFilthyFrank YouTube channel and was known for offensive, shocking, alternative, and filthy humor. Filming himself, his friends, and the bizarre entities living in his house, Frank became the star of his own show: The Filthy Frank Show. An internet comedian, vlogger, Chef, musician, satirist, and absolute madman, Filthy Frank was the edgiest man on the internet. He was described as the literal embodiment of "everything a person should not be". Along with being the former protagonist of the videos, he was also the protagonist of the book named after him; Francis of the Filth.

                
            <br>
            Frank was last seen alongside Pink Guy and Yadaran preparing to fight Chin-Chin one last time. Because of the discontinuation of the Filthy Frank series, it's unknown who was the eventual victor in this conflict, but it can be safely assumed that Frank and his allies were victorious.
